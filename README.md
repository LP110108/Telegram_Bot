This is Telegram bot. Telegram bot gives the weather for today.

This bot has 3 commands: "_/start_", "_/help_" and "_/weather_".

The weather is obtained from the site https://openweathermap.org/.

API that I used: pyTelegramBotAPI (https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) 
                 weather (https://openweathermap.org/api).
